# Fronteers website

This is the Fronteers website repository. Here, together we build the new [Fronteers.nl](https://fronteers.nl). You're welcome to join us! This is a great opportunity to learn from other developers that you would normally never work with.

## Hold up - Fronteers?

Founded in 2007, Fronteers is the non-profit professional association of Dutch-speaking front-end developers (and non-Dutch speaking, but living in the Netherlands). Its goals include the professionalisation of our trade, (improved) recognition of the front-end discipline, and improving the position of front-end developers in their companies and the web design/development world in general.

We have been quite successful in reaching these goals, as the position of front-end developers within the Netherlands has improved markedly. Companies know they can expect a lot from professional front-end developers, and accordingly afford them a lot of respect.

### Why is this project open sourced?

We are a community that wants to be inclusive, and we promote learning from eachother. To this end we organise meetups, workshops, informal networking events, and a yearly conference. But what better way to learn from eachother than by getting your hands on a keyboard, and working on technical challenges together in something that will look great on your portfolio? Wether you're a junior developer, a happy amateur, a senior colleague or just curious, we all have something to learn from eachother. For junior developers who have done a bootcamp but haven't found a place to work yet, this can be a great place to get used to git, learn what it is like working with professional developers, and get feedback on your work.

You are welcome to [join us on Slack](https://fronteers-slack.herokuapp.com/). Most of our Slack members talk in Dutch, but we have a #fronteers_english channel, and will never ignore you if you ask something in English elsewhere.
