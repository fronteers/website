     <p>Starting at a very young age with GW-Basic, Ruben knew that software development would play an important part of his life.

     <p>However, his first experience with VR at the HCC Beurs at a very young age would also play an integral role in his future. When VR became a hot item again in 2012, he held off from buying development kits and focused on phone-based HMDs like the Durovis Dive and Google Cardboard, before getting more experience with the HTC Vive later. As co-founder of the <a href="http://realitylab.nl">Reality Lab</a>, he’s ready to develop for and discuss the topic with anyone willing to listen.</p>
