     <p>We're very proud that Fronteers Conference veteran, tall person and all-around front-end development expert Phil Hawksworth has agreed to be our Host for the day.

     <p>After graduating as an astronomer, Nadieh became a data scientist finding insights in the vast amounts of data that are hidden within many companies.

These days she’s even working on data visualization full-time during the day in the front-end team of Adyen.</p>
     <p>Her favorite data visualizations border on the data art side while still conveying insights.</p>
