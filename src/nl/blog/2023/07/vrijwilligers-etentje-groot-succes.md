On Thursday, July 27th, we dined at LE:EN in Utrecht with existing and new volunteers, discussing Fronteers. As previously mentioned in an earlier post, we were [seeking volunteers](/nl/blog/2023/07/vrijwilligers-gezocht) to help revitalize the association.

Well, we succeeded! Between the "Sprinkhaan Green Goddess"-without-Sprinkhaan and the Choco Pie, we went through the attendees. We now have (the beginning of) a workshop committee, a complete education committee, and a complete marketing and communication committee. Additionally, there are three potential candidates for the board whom we plan to introduce to the role before the General Assembly.

Furthermore, Fronteers still has an active committee in Belgium and the conference committee (currently considering the future of the Fronteers conference), as well as occasional volunteers who lend their expertise in areas such as accessibility or help with the website.

It would be ideal to add three more names to the [workshop committee](/nl/blog/2023/07/vrijwilligers-gezocht#:~:text=3%20mensen%20voor%20de%20workshopcommissie) and combine it with the activities committee, so we can organize several enjoyable and educational workshops and gatherings once again!
