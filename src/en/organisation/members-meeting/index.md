The board organizes a general meeting of members at least once per calendar year. This traditionally takes place at the end of the year, so that the past congress and the budget for the coming year can be discussed. If necessary, the board can organize several members' meetings per year, and the members can also organize one by means of a conference call. a call by at least 10% of the members. Announcement of the GMM always takes place in writing to all members, no later than 1 week prior to the date of the GMM.

The GMM is effectively the highest body within the association, where assignments can be given to the board and plans of the board can be adjusted. In practice, this will mainly manifest itself in the approval or rejection of specific points in the budget, and in the approval or rejection of submitted policy proposals.

At an average members' meeting, the various committees briefly present their results from the past year and plans for the coming year. The treasurer presents the annual accounts of the previous year, the financial situation of the current year (if known), and the budget for the coming year. The audit committee reports on the audit of the annual accounts. Any policy proposals (from the board or the members) are discussed, and the board election takes place.

According to [the statutes](/nl/association/statuten) the annual accounts must in principle be presented within 6 months, but [the GMM of 2011](/nl/vereniging/bestuur/minutes/07-12-2011.html) has this term is permanently extended to 12 months.

The board must consist of at least three members, but can be as many as the board deems desirable. As long as the number of board candidates to be elected does not exceed the number of available positions within the board, all candidates who receive at least 50% + 1 of the votes cast will be elected. If the number of candidates exceeds the number of positions, all candidates will still need 50% + 1 of the votes cast to be elected, but the election may take place over several rounds, with the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated until the number of candidates is equal to the number of positions available. Specific rules in this regard can be found in the articles of association.

Board members are in principle elected for a term of three years, unless they fill the position of an interim board member retiring, in which case they are elected for the remaining term. Board members may retire prematurely and may also seek re-election after their term has expired. The ALV can suspend board members.

Non-attending members may authorize attending members to vote on their behalf. Each member present can be authorized by a maximum of two non-present members. The board must have received authorizations no later than 24 hours prior to the ALV, so that there is enough time to register them.
