Fronteers is an association with full legal capacity, established in October 2007. Our mission: to professionalise the profession of front-end developer. The [board](/en/organisation/board/) of the association is responsible for the day-to-day affairs, but outsources the organization of most of the association's activities to a number of [committees](/en/organisation/committees/). Fronteers runs entirely on volunteers. However - in order to spare volunteers as much as possible - where necessary we cooperate with external parties to support the various committees.

Fronteers currently unites [approximately 200 front-end developers](/en/members). Both employees of large and small web agencies, as well as freelancers and employees of non-web agencies are involved in the association.

Although Fronteers currently consists mostly of professional, full-time front-end developers, anyone can [join](/en/join-us), provided he or she understands the objectives and main resources of Fronteers endorses.

Fronteers was supported during its establishment by the [Platform for Internet Agencies Netherlands](https://dutchdigitalagencies.com/), in which approximately 40 of the largest web agencies in the Netherlands are united. The name "Fronteers" and our original logo were created by [Edenspiekermann](http://www.edenspiekermann.com/) shortly after its foundation. The copyright on this rests with the association. The new logo and website design were designed by [Ready for Take-off](https://rfto.nl/).

The objective of Fronteers is the professionalization of the profession of web front-end developer; and the recognition and improvement of the position of, as well as the support of, Dutch-language web front-end developers.

Quite a mouthful, but the bottom line is that we want the front-end to finally get the exposure it deserves. We have a great profession and everyone should know that.

To achieve this goal, a [number of committees](/en/organisation/committees) have been set up.
