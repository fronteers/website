Fronteers was founded in October 2007. In the months before it became clear that an association like this would have a right to exist. On April 27, 2007, Peter-Paul Koch gathered 12 people in Amsterdam to discuss his plans to establish a union for front-end developers. A month later 50 people at Lost Boys also found this an interesting idea.

The temporary name, which came up through a questionnaire, was something with *guild* and *front-end*; Guild of Front-Enders. In the months that followed, this name was retained. During the founding congress in Pakhuis De Zwijger, the name was voted down.

After a digital vote from 37 [proposed names](/en/organisation/history/names) it turned out that *Fronteers* was preferred and this became the name.
