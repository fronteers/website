On this page you will find the names for the "Guild" that have been proposed by members in the run-up to its establishment, as well as board advice on this.
All provisional members were allowed to vote, and the result was _Fronteers_.

## Board advice

This board advice came about in close consultation with Edenspiekermann (then Eden Design), which (as a sponsor) had a name specialist look at our naming problem and made some proposals.

Of course you can completely ignore this advice if you feel like it, but we request that you at least read the reasoning.

Most of the proposed names fall into the concrete, descriptive category (Professional Association for Front-end Developers, Trade Association for Front-end Developers, etc.). The advantage of such a name is that it is immediately clear to everyone what it is all about; the disadvantage is that they are hard to remember for an outsider and will therefore be abbreviated immediately (BvFO, VFED, etc.) Such an abbreviation is not desirable, because it only obscures things: no one will immediately know what the VFED is for stands.

Some names are internal jokes that a front-ender will immediately understand, but not an outsider. Example: &lt;body&gt;, The Source, The Front. A layman will not know what this means. Foggy pseudo-medical company? Mineral water store? Facing stone setter? Since we also want to focus on non-front-enders, such a name is not recommended.

Some names are nice in themselves, but too general, and also don't have an easy domain available. Example: Argo, Avantgarde. Lay people have an association with this, but that is not necessarily the association we want them to have.

The domain name problem also applies to many of the proposed names, with the exception of the difficult abbreviations such as BvFO, but do we want a domain bvfo.nl or vfed.nl that no one can remember?

A good name is somewhat associative, but does not stray too far from a concrete description. Based on this, Edenspiekermann suggested three names, and the board is happy to adopt them:

1. Fronteers
2. Frontalent
3. Frontact

All these three names have an association, are easy to remember, and the domains have been reserved by Edenspiekermann for the time being. The argumentation of board favorite Fronteers can be found further on.

## Voting procedure

To vote, we used the so-called [Instant Runoff Voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) method, where each voter could submit a list of their preferences.

## Arguments

The following arguments have been submitted:

## Argo

Argo is the ship with which the Greek heroes went in search of the Golden Fleece. On board were Ajax and J(a)son, among others.
The ship offered them protection and carried them from adventure to adventure.
Members could then be Argonauts.
I think the ship metaphor can be quite fun for an association like this. Discover, adventures, exploring new worlds, heroes; all good associations.

## Avantgarde

Means vanguard.

## &lt;body&gt;

&lt;body&gt; stands for the organization: the guild embodies our common goal to further develop our field and in addition, &lt;body&gt; is of course the element within which the various front-end techniques come together and the spectacle largely takes place, both for the user and the
