-   After approval by e-mail, you can e-mail the vacancy text and any images.
-   The text can contain headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links and (contact) forms; these are presented in the Fronteers house style.

    -   All available vacancies are shown on the Vacaturebank homepage in the order they were added.

    -   All available vacancies are shown on the Fronteers homepage in the order they were added.
    -   All vacancies are tweeted via our Twitter account, with a link back to the site.
-   After 30 days, the vacancy remains online in our archive, if desired with a message that this concerns an old or already filled vacancy.

## Lead time

-   The placement of the vacancy takes place by volunteers. You explicitly agree that placement may take several days as a result.
-   Certainly in busy periods (eg around the conference) pressure to speed up this process is not appreciated.
