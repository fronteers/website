On November 28, 2025 from 20:00 - 22:00, the 2025 ALV (Annual General Meeting) will take place. During this meeting, we will look back on the past year. We will also decide what will happen with Fronteers in the coming board year. We therefore call on you to make your voice heard now!

If you want to bring up topics as a member, you can always do so. We want to have the slides with the agenda and main topics ready by November 21. 

## Proposals

Do you have a good idea that will also appeal to fellow front-end developers? You can submit that idea. During the meeting, votes will be cast on the ideas. You can discuss your idea in advance with other members on [Slack](https://fronteersnl.slack.com/).

To submit an idea, you can send an email to <bestuur@fronteers.nl>.

## Board

Wim van Iersel is already in his third year as a board member and treasurer. Anneke Sinnema, Jewwy Qadri, Christian Schaefer and Claudia Reynders will remain as board members.

We could use some help on the board. Interested members can apply at <bestuur@fronteers.nl>. 

During the members' meeting, votes will be cast, and all board candidates with more than 50 percent of the votes will join the board. The elected board members will then choose from among themselves a chairperson, secretary and treasurer.
