## New board of 2023

On Friday the 10th of November we gathered online for our annual ALV (general meeting of community members). As some of you might already be aware, both Anneke Sinnema and Edwin Martin decided to not continue another 3-year run on the board. Both Anneke and Edwin have played a crucial role for Fronteers over the past 6 years, Anneke as chair and Edwin as secretary.
With the pandemic this surely hasn't been the easiest of tasks so we now see them off on a well deserved break. Both will still play a part in Fronteers in the future, just in a different role.

As is tradition new candidates came forward and members had the opportunity to cast their votes. The newly chosen board members are Christian “Schepp” Schaefer, Jewwy Qadri and Claudia Reynders.

In the weeks following the ALV, the old and new board convened and new roles were assigned as follows:

_Wim van Iersel_ (banaan666) continues his role as treasurer after taking over from Sander Vink last year.
During the week you can find Wim working as webmaster / front-end developer for Tillburg. You can also [read Wim’s official introduction on the Fronteers blog](https://fronteers.nl/blog/2022/11/nieuw-bestuurslid-wim-van-iersel).

_Christian Schaefer_ (schepp), call name “Schepp”, assists our secretary with documentation and communication. Schepp has a rather long history as a Fronteers member and is one of the very few German ones. After volunteering for a few years for the conference he finally became part of the conference committee in 2019. He co-hosts a weekly German podcast on frontend development since 2010, now approaching 600 episodes. Schepp is also co-organizer of two meetups: the local Düsseldorf meetup Webworker NRW (2014 - paused since 2020) and the online-only CSS Café (since 2020).

_Jewwy Qadri_ (Jewwy), succeeds Edwin as Secretary. Jewwy joined the conference committee in 2019 and was not only part of a wonderful edition but also has been most eager to reboot things after the pandemic. Jewwy recently also joined the workshop committee where he seeks even more opportunities to help organise things. In his job, Jewwy worked as a front-end developer in the e-commerce sector for more than a decade, before recently joining an accessibility consultancy. When he’s not wrangling code or pushing Fronteers forward, he further sharpens his professional bowling skills.

_Claudia Reynders_ (Claudia R) succeeds Anneke as Chair after being part of the Belgian committee since late 2019 as event organiser. During the day Claudia works as community lead for a Belgian coding school called BeCode, where she helps shape the future of new developers and influences their curriculum to include important practices and knowledge.

And on this note we wish you all a wonderful start of the new year! We’re looking forward to continue building out the Fronteers community!
