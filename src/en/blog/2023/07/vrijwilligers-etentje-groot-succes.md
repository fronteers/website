On Thursday, July 27, we had dinner with existing and new volunteers at LE:EN in Utrecht and discussed Fronteers. As discussed in an earlier post, [we are looking for volunteers](/nl/blog/2023/07/volunteers-gezocht) to help us revive the association.

Well, we did it! Between the "Grasshopper Green Goddess"-without-Grasshopper and the Choco Pie, we visited the attendees. We now have (the beginning of) a workshop committee, a full education committee and a full marketing and communications committee. There are also three possible candidates for the board who we would like to introduce to that role for the AGM in the near future.

Fronteers also has an active committee in Belgium and the conference committee (which is currently considering the future of the Fronteers Congress), and occasional volunteers who lend their expertise, for example in the field of accessibility or help with the website.

It would be best to add three more names to the workshop committee and then combine this with the activities committee, so that we can again organize a number of fun and educational workshops and meetings!
