We've already gotten off to a good start with an update to our [activities calendar](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/activities/), which we've enthusiastically filled with our ambitions for this year.

This week on Thursday, we're celebrating the new year with a [drinks event](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/activities/#15-january-2026-new-year-drinks-in-utrecht) in Utrecht. At 18:00 we'll gather at Het Gegeven Paard in Utrecht (near the station), where we'll have some food together and raise a toast to the new year. Sign up via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/fronteers-nl/events/312421148/?slug=fronteers-nl) or by emailing [anneke@fronteers.nl](mailto:anneke@fronteers.nl)!

We're also organizing Fronteers: Dark Mode again this year, a cozy evening with top speakers in Dordrecht. Last year, this event was highly appreciated for its unique setup and the quality of the presentations. Tickets cost only €49 for our members, €99 for non-members, and include a two course dinner (a main plus choice between a starter or a dessert) and a number of drink vouchers.

Make sure you're signed up for our [newsletter](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/information/newsletter/) so we can keep you informed about the ticket sales opening later this month. For more information, see our page about [Dark Mode](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/conference/).

## Discounts for Fronteers Members

This year, there's no shortage of cool events for developers. In addition to our own Dark Mode event in October, we can look forward to the very first [SmashingConf Amsterdam 2026](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/activities/#13-april-2026-smashingconf-amsterdam-2026) (from April 13-16). Fronteers members get a 20% discount on tickets!

[CSS Day](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/activities/#11-june-2026-css-day-2026) is also back, on June 11 and 12. Fronteers members get a €100 discount. We're still discussing the exact terms.
Ticket sales will be announced first in the [CSS Day newsletter](https://cssday.nl/subscribe).

In short, multiple opportunities to connect this year, meet colleagues, and learn from each other. We look forward to seeing you this year! Not a member of Fronteers yet? [You can support us for €72.60 per year](https://www.fronteers.nl/en/join-us). In addition to the fact that you'll easily recoup your membership with the above discount offers, you'll be supporting our association and volunteers to continue organizing meetups and social activities.

## Call for Contributions

On February 6, we'd like to hold a lunch meeting! The lunch meeting is an online meeting during lunch that you can follow from behind your desk (but from your couch or in the park works too). We're looking for a speaker to show (and tell), or just speak about a particular topic, during lunch.

We'd also like to hold a Fronteers meetup at the end of February. For this, we're looking for a location to host the meetup, two speakers to give presentations, and one or more sponsors for food and drinks. Can you help with any of these? [Get in touch with us!](mailto:bestuur@fronteers.nl)

Do you live in Belgium? We'd like to restart our meetups and community there in 2026. You can help us by filling out this [short survey](https://tally.so/r/rjOy7M). With this, we hope to find out how we can best keep you informed about upcoming meetups, what your reasons are for coming to meetups, and what type of meetup you prefer. Let's rebuild the Belgian front-end community together. Feel free to tag a colleague who should see this or share this post to help us reach as many developers as possible!
