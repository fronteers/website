First of all, by becoming a member you naturally support front-end web development itself as a discipline. The main goal of Fronteers is the professionalization of our profession. By becoming a member and making your voice heard, you put the front-end on the map. Our vacancy database in particular shows that this works.

Fronteers organizes monthly meetings, always in collaboration with a company or educational institution. These meetings take place all over the country. In the evening, two or three speakers will talk about subjects with which the speaker has a great deal of knowledge or experience. Not only very educational, but also a great opportunity to get in touch with fellow Fronteers. Being part of the network of professional front-enders is an important aspect of the association. This is also reflected in the presence on Slack.

Every year, Fronteers organizes an international conference, which is now known as one of the best front-end conferences in the world. As a member of the association you make this possible and you receive a hefty discount for this. We are also working on strengthening ties with other (European) conferences, and members can also expect discounts for those conferences. Keep an eye on 'member discount' on our blog for this.

Just like any other association, Fronteers is not only for members, but also by members. As a member you can develop initiatives that benefit our field, which will be supported by the association.

Each member is subscribed to the Fronteers mailing list for members. This list is used by the board to send an update to all members a few times a year, with the latest state of affairs and links to the latest Fronteers blog posts. Invitations for General Member Meetings, for example, are also sent to this list. A member cannot unsubscribe from this list.

In addition, Fronteers organizes workshops, which can be visited by members at a discount.

Fronteer members receive substantial discounts from various international publishers of books relevant to front-enders.

You can register as a member by sending an e-mail to the treasurer:
