title: Code of conduct
key: code-of-conduct

All members of our Fronteers Slack channel are required to agree with the following code of conduct. The admins of the Slack channel will enforce this code throughout the entire Slack channel. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. Need Help?

You can send a direct message to @charis on Slack, or send an email to charis@fronteers.nl.

## The Quick Version

This Slack channel is dedicated to providing a harassment-free Slack channel experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of Slack channel participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any channel. Slack members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the Fronteers Slack at the discretion of the Slack admins.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

## Need help?

If you mention @mods in any of the channels, they’ll get a message.

If you’d prefer to contact somebody more privately, send a direct message to a moderator of your choice: @anneke, @iejun, @josee or @charis.

## Moderation

_Three strikes and you’re out:_ if you have received three warnings your account will be deactivated for 30 days.

After the 30 day suspension period you account will be reactivated but your behaviour will be monitored closely. If you break the Code of Conduct again after suspension, or if you make a new (second) account to gain access to the Slack your account will be deactivated indefinitely.

Each Slack moderator can give a warning. The moderator’s decisions are final and can not be appealed.
