Membership of Fronteers is _personal_, and is therefore independent of any employer.

## Contribution

For students, these amounts are halved, to {{ general-info.students_contribution }} and {{ general-info.students_discounted }}.

The contribution is {{ general-info.contribution }} (including 21% VAT). Members who sign up after June 30 will pay {{ general-info.contribution_discounted }}. You are only a member of the association after payment of the invoice. Volunteers receive a 50% discount.

## Student membership

The contribution for students at a higher educational institution is {{ general-info.students_contribution }} (including VAT). Students who register after June 30 pay {{ general-info.students_discounted }}. To make use of student membership, you must indicate that you are a student when registering and send proof of registration from the educational institution to the board (every year). (It is not possible to register as a student after invoicing to claim a student discount, although this will of course be taken into account for the next calendar year.)

## Why join?

First of all, by becoming a member you naturally support front-end web development itself as a discipline. The main goal of Fronteers is the professionalization of our profession. By becoming a member and making your voice heard, you put the front-end on the map. In particular [our vacancy database](/nl/werk-en-freelance/) shows that this works.

Fronteers, always in collaboration with a company or educational institution, organizes [monthly meetings](/nl/activities/events/). These meetings take place all over the country. In the evening, two or three speakers will talk about subjects with which the speaker has a great deal of knowledge or experience. Not only very educational, but also a great opportunity to get in touch with fellow Fronteers. Being part of the network of professional front-enders is an important aspect of the association.

Every year Fronteers organizes an international [congress](/en/congress), which is now known as one of the best front-end congresses in the world. As a member of the association you make this possible and you receive a hefty discount for this. We are also working on strengthening ties with other (European) conferences, and members can also expect discounts for those conferences. Keep an eye on our blog for this.

Just like any other association, Fronteers is not only for members, but also by members. As a member you can develop initiatives that benefit our field, which will be supported by the association.

Each member is subscribed to the Fronteers mailing list for members. This list is used by the board to send an update to all members a few times a year, with the latest state of affairs and links to the latest Fronteers blog posts. Invitations for General Member Meetings, for example, are also sent to this list. A member cannot unsubscribe from this list.

In addition, Fronteers organizes [workshops](/nl/activities/workshops/), which can be visited by members at a discount.

Fronteer members receive substantial discounts from various international publishers of [books relevant to front-enders](/nl/word-lid/ledenkorting).

You can register as a member via the [registration form](/nl/become-lid/).

## Cancel membership

Membership is tacitly renewed. If a member wants to cancel his or her membership, this must be communicated to the member administration one month before the start of the new year.
