## Talk #1 - Practical solutions for accessible components
Irrespective of using a framework or not, much has been written about and less is available to make or keep your interactive components accessible. Without any agreed upon or defacto standards when it comes to implementation, it is worthwhile to know some standard solutions to common accessibility challenges, as well as being able to implement them yourself. How to manage focus, and how to trap it? `activedescendant` and comboboxes: what do you actually need? And what about tabs and operating them by keyboard? In this talk I'll explore all those, and hopefully inspire you to build your own!
