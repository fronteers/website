Fronteers provides workshops and as an association, we rely on those available within our own ranks to conduct a workshop. Depending on the availability of trainers, we offer workshops ranging from beginner to expert levels.

## More information for trainers

Fronteers does not have trainers on its payroll. As an association, we are entirely dependent on those available within our own ranks. If you are interested in giving a training, you can let us know by [contacting the board](mailto:bestuur@fronteers.nl). We would like to know how much experience you have in giving training, which training you would like to give, and at what level you could provide the training.

### Fine print

For giving a course under the Fronteers banner, the following applies:

-   Fronteers announces the workshop in advance on fronteers.nl.
-   Fronteers provides workshop space (usually) in Utrecht, with lunch included.
-   Workshops are conducted under the Fronteers banner, but trainers may promote their own business to a limited extent. However, a workshop under the Fronteers banner is not a day of advertising.
-   If a trainer requires software, the trainer must distribute or make the software available themselves.
-   Trainers receive a fee of €1250 per workshop, regardless of the number of participants.
-   Fronteers reserves the right to reject a trainer without stating a reason or not to proceed with a workshop.
