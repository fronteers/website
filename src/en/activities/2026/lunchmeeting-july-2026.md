We're organizing a Fronteers lunchmeeting in late July 2026. The lunchmeeting is an online meeting during lunch that you can follow from behind your desk (but also from your couch or in the park).

We're currently looking for a **speaker** to show (and tell), or just speak on a certain subject, during lunch.

If you can help, please [get in touch](mailto:bestuur@fronteers.nl?subject=Fronteers%20Lunchmeeting%20-%20Late%20July%202026)!
