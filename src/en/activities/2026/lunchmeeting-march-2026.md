Fronteers lunchmeetings are online meetings during lunch that you can follow from behind your desk (but also from your couch or in the park). Fronteers team member Edwin Martin is your host!

This Fronteers lunchmeeting features Mark Teekman! Mark has built an accessible starter theme for the Astro framework ([Accessible Astro Starter](https://astro.build/themes/details/accessible-astro-starter/)).
