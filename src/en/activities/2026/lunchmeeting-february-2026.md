This is the first Fronteers lunchmeeting of 2026! The lunchmeeting is an online meeting during lunch that you can follow from behind your desk (but also from your couch or in the park).

This time Rosita Rampertaap will show the theme she built for her own website, with considerations and a look into her process!

When you sign up via Meetup.com you'll see the meeting link. It will also be shared the afternoon itself via our Slack.

Next session will be in march 2026. For that, we're currently looking for a **speaker** to show (and tell), or just speak on a certain subject, during lunch. If you'd like to help, please [get in touch](mailto:bestuur@fronteers.nl?subject=Fronteers%20Lunchmeeting%20-%20Early%20January%202026)!
